# Chatting-Robot
This repository is about the Chatting Robot, there are STL files for the designed parts including the assembly.

In this task it is requisted to design a Chatting Robot (Bot), this robot will be set on mall or any store that have customers
visit them, this robot duty is to recieve the evaluation from customers about the service that the store give. This robot will
use one type of motor called Servo Motor, six motors are used in this robot, three motors for each arm, these motors has been 
modified to be connected between the arm joints. Also, on these motors it has been used bearings to protect the motor and arm, 
and to reduce the load, the type of bearing used is Radial Ball Bearing, this bearing has been taking from the ISO Standard, 
the configuration name of this Bearing is "ISO 15 RBB - 178 - 20,DE,AC,20_68", and the total number of bearing used are 8 bearings. 
The arm with name "Arm 01" has been used in both sides, "Arm 02" this arm has been used in the left side, "Arm 03" has been used in 
the right side, the reason of making "Arm 02 and 03" because there are differece between the fingers direction in each side. 
The "Head" part has been cutted from downside to make the area that let the wires move and keep them not visible. Also, the "Base" 
part has cutted in the middle of the square to make the area for the wires and make small area on the circle in the downside 
of the "Base" part.
